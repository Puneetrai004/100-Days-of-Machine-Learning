# 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning
Adding Information learned during my 100 days of journey to learn ML.

Feature Scaling
1. Standardization (StandardScaler())
2. Normalization (a. MinMaxScaler() - Used for Neural Networks(like CNNs to make data fall in Range[0,1]), b. MaxAbsScaler() - Sparse Data(Data with lot of zeros), c.RobustScaler() - Better Perform on Outliers.
